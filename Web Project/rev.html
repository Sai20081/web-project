                    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Firstly, I wanna start off with the foods. I ordered Chicken Rice and Kiwi Juice. They taste fine. But, the waiting time is a little to much for me. I had to wait around 30 minutes till I get my food. Also the service, its not pretty bad to other restaurants but it wasnt great either. The price is pretty affordable for the upper-middle class but I still think that the costs need to be reduced by a little bit. I recommend you to increase the rate of the employee too. Throughout the whole meal, the service was teribble. I had to call thrice for them to reach me. The overall service was pretty OK though.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you are a burmese traditional food lover, I highly recommend you to come here. The food here is amazing, the aesthetics of the restaurant is pretty too. Although the service isnt the best, it is tolerable for me. I ordered coconut gravy and noodles, they were so good. The portion is enough for one person too. The price range is affordable. The service is a solid 3 out of 5, food is a 5 out of 5. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant.</p>

                    <h2>Sarah</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi there! I'm Sarah. Today, I went to a Burmese Local Restaurant called Shwe Nyar Thu. The waiters were friendly with me, I didn't know what to pick here because the option is quite a lot here. The waiters explained to me how the dishes are. I decided to order Mohinga, the Burmese traditional dish. It tasted so good compared to the price range. I feel welcomed here by the staff. The place is pretty nice too. This restaurant is a 5 out of 5 for me!</p>
